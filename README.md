This is a ray tracer I created which renders ellipsoids using local illumination, reflection, and shadows.
The "eye" is located at the origin, viewing the near plane located on the negative z axis. 

The data is inputed through a text file which specifies the values of the scenes colour, lighting, and dimensions.
The data is outputed in a ppm file format.
